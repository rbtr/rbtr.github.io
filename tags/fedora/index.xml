      <description>Update strategies Today I&#39;m setting up automatic updates on all of my Fedora machines.
There are several school&#39;s of thought regarding keeping your systems up to date. In the cloud space recently the buzzword has been &amp;ldquo;immutable infrastructure&amp;rdquo; - the idea that your virtual-server&#39;s base operating system is fixed - effectively read-only - and you perform system updates by deploying new virtual machines and deleting the old ones. I can&#39;t throw my laptop away every time there&#39;s a new kernel version out, so this doesn&#39;t work for me!</description>

      <description>This is part of my series on renovating my homelabs to ring in the roaring &amp;lsquo;20s.
Today I&#39;ll be attempting to recover a machine that failed a Fedora version upgrade (v29-&amp;gt;v30) and now won&#39;t boot.
Sections:  Troubleshooting Broken GRUB Booting a Live USB and chrooting Data transfer with rsync   Troubleshooting GRUB When we try to boot the machine, we&#39;re greeted with the following prompt:
grub&amp;gt; This usually indicates that GRUB is okay but it can&#39;t find the config or the the files it needs to boot the OS (the initramfs).</description>

      <description>It was an extraordinarily busy and educational past year for me, working in the cloud computing space. In preparation for the &amp;lsquo;20s, I spent the (not-so-)quiet time off of work at the end of last year rebuilding several home networks, installing and configuring personal servers, and otherwise leveling-up my homelabs - redoing and improving things now that I know better. This multiparter is a log of that!
