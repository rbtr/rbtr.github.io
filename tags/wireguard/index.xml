      <description>This is part of my series on renovating my homelabs to ring in the roaring &amp;lsquo;20s.
I previously wrote about setting up a PiHole and configured all my devices on the network to use it and get ads blocked at the DNS level. I also set up my WireGuard connected clients to be able to take advantage of that appliance even when I&#39;m traveling - as long as I can establish a secure WireGuard tunnel.</description>

      <description>This is part of my series on renovating my homelabs to ring in the roaring &amp;lsquo;20s.
I previously wrote about setting up a WireGuard VPN that allows me to connect to my LAN while offsite. Today I&#39;ll be setting up a PiHole and explaining how I can use this to block ads for any device on my network or connected to my VPN.
Sections:  Containerized PiHole Using the PiHole for DNS  On the LAN Over WireGuard     Setting up the PiHole I&#39;m going to run my PiHole as a containerized process, using the official Docker image.</description>

      <description>This is part of my series on renovating my homelabs to ring in the roaring &amp;lsquo;20s.
In this post I&#39;m going to set up WireGuard, an exciting new in-kernel VPN technology from Jason Donenfield. It will be landing in the core Linux kernel very soon (probably in 5.6)!
Setting up a VPN will let me access devices at any of my sites without having to expose all of those devices directly to the internet.</description>

      <description>It was an extraordinarily busy and educational past year for me, working in the cloud computing space. In preparation for the &amp;lsquo;20s, I spent the (not-so-)quiet time off of work at the end of last year rebuilding several home networks, installing and configuring personal servers, and otherwise leveling-up my homelabs - redoing and improving things now that I know better. This multiparter is a log of that!
